## Defining multislice forward model for electron diffraction with mixed probe/object modes of 3D objects

import torch
from torch.fft import fft2, ifft2

from ptyrad.utils import fftshift2

# The forward model takes a batch of object patches and probes with their mixed states
# By introducing and aligning the singleton dimensions carefully, 
# we can vectorize all the operations except the serial z-dimension propagation
# For 3D object with n_slices, the for loop would go through n-1 loops and multiply the last slice without further Fresnel propagaiton
# This way we can skip the if statement and make it slightly faster 
# For 2D object (n_slices = 1), the entire for loop is skipped
# Note that element-wise multiplication of tensor (*) is defaulted as out-of-place operation
# So new tensor is being created and referenced to the old graph to keep the gradient flowing

    """
    Computes the multislice electron diffraction pattern with multiple incoherent probe 
    and object modes using a vectorized forward model.

    Args:
        object_patches (torch.Tensor): Tensor of shape (N, omode, Nz, Ny, Nx, 2), representing
            pseudo-complex object patches with float32 amplitude and phase components. 
            N is the number of samples in a batch, omode is the number of object modes, 
            Nz, Ny, Nx are the dimensions of the object patches.
        omode_occu (torch.Tensor): Tensor of shape (omode,) with float32 values, representing 
            the occupancy/expectation for each object mode. The sum of all elements should be 1.
        probe (torch.Tensor): Tensor of shape (N, pmode, Ny, Nx) with complex64 values, 
            representing the probe(s). N is the number of samples in the batch, pmode is the 
            number of probe modes. By default, N is 1, assuming the same probe for all samples.
        H (torch.Tensor): Tensor of shape (N, Ky, Kx) with complex64 values, representing the Fresnel 
            propagator that propagates the wave by a slice thickness.
        eps (float, optional): A small value added for numerical stability. Defaults to 1e-10.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: Tensor of shape (N, Ky, Kx) with float32 positive values, representing the 
        forward diffraction pattern for each sample in the batch.
